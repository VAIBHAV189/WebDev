            <b>What is Lorem Ipsum?</b><br>
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br>
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br>

            <b>Why do we use it?</b><br>
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.<br>
            The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.<br>
            Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.<br> 
            Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).<br>
